Hi, I'm Darko Todoroski.<br>
I write, speak, tweet, and share everything that I learn and I think is useful to be shared with the world or with myself.<br>
I'm part of the elite warriors at Microsoft, making the cloud look like a sun for our customers.<br><br>
 
I love what I do, so I share what I learned about Cloud, Identity, Automation, DevOps, Personal improvement, and many more. If you love these topics as well, you will feel right at home here.<br><br>

</p>

These quotes below explain the reason for starting my blog.<br><br>

<blockquote>
    "New ideas need audiences like flowers need bees. No matter how brilliant, they will die unless others work to spread them." - Simon Sinek <br>
    "If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive - no matter how skilled or talented you are." - Cal Newport, Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World
</blockquote>

I'm made in Macedonia <img src="/assets/posts/windows-as-a-service-rings.png" alt="Macedonian flag" data-loaded="true"> and exported to The Netherlands. I share my life with my lovely wife and two sons. I love traveling and photography.<br>
I combat digital distraction and trying to live my life using technology but not be consumed by it. Your attention is the product that is being sold. - The Social Dilemma<br><br>

<blockquote>"Simply put, humans are not wired to be constantly wired." - Cal Newport, Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</blockquote>

I build this world brick by brick, one small share at a time, and I will continue to do so. Thank you so much for your support, my reader.<br><br>

A share from you would help me a lot to grow this world.<br>
Therefore
<ul>
    <li>Tweet it!</li>
    <li>Share to your favorite platform, blog, LinkedIn, etc.</li>
</ul>

If you enjoy my writing, follow me for even greater things that come.<br><br>

<blockquote><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Yes, I do work at Microsoft. But the opinions here are my own. You can share everything you read, but before you take the advice, think with your head. :)</blockquote><br>
